I will daily upload medium-easy competitive coding problem and solution here.

Problem 1 (caesar_cypher.py) : A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter of the plain text is substituted with a letter found by moving n places down the alphabet.
You are to write a function that accepts two arguments, a plain-text message, and a number of letters to shift in the cipher. The function will return an encrypted string with all letters transformed and all punctuation and whitespace remaining unchanged.
Plain Text can be in upper case or lower case but ciphertext always is in lower case.

Problem 2 (balancedparanthesis) : 
Balanced parentheses means that each opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of parentheses are properly nested.

Problem 3 (graph.py) : 
Perform different graph functions and operations using python and implement it.
